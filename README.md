Submitted by: **Elyod Abraham**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used https://www.w3schools.com/ to learn how to make circular buttons and a restart button to the game.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I've had very little exposue to Html, CSS, and Javascript so working with these langauges was a little challenging and I struggled with the syntax and formatting from the beginning. I, however, read through W3Schools and the spec provided by CodePath which made the project easier to comprehend. I was able to take a lot from the project and I was amazed at the simplicty of the code yet complex forms that could be built with little work. Furthermore, I struggled with the logic a bit and wasn't sure how the guessing logic would best work. I read through the spec and after several attempts had to use the hint because my code has several issues. I read through the hint and tried out the code on the console to better understand and I was able to fully understand it before implementing it in the project. I can say that I now understand the logic of the game and can explain it pretty well.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Web developemnt has such a large spectrum of capabilties ot it and I'm wondering how it's possible that one can gain a good understanding in all those areas. It's such a big field and almost like game development in the sense that there are infinite things you can create. It is such a vast field and I'm excited to learn more about web developemnt. I was also wondering what someone can do if they're also interested in backend programming as well? Would web development still be something I can have time to work on, or would I have to divde tasks?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time, I would definetly improve the asthetic of the game and the formatting of the pieces. I would also import images to use as buttons and make the animation of the game funner for people. This would allow the game to be more presentable as the current model I worked on is more of a rough draft. I would also work on the optional features and implement more complex sounds, a timer for the user, and a different pattern for each game. This in turn would make it more competitive for the user.
